# Test-Cases
The folder **Test-Cases** contains an .html document with the Test Cases for the project and an .xml file. The html file has an index with links to each TC. Each TC  has a  description, its execution type, importance and the Requirements that covers as well as other information like keywords. The .xml file allows you to import the Test Cases to [TestLink](http://testlink.org/) so you can update or modify the project in Testlink.
