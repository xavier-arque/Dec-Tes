# Requirements
This folder contains documents related with the requirements of the project. 

The requirements file has an index with links to each requirement. Each requirement has a  description, its status, its relations and the Test Cases created for this requirement as well as other information like coverage, links to the test and code created by codegram in github or other relevant information. 

```Coverage: A value of e.g. "40% (8/20)" means that 20 Test Cases have to be created for this Requirement to test it completely. 8 of those have already been created and linked to this Requirement, which makes a coverage of 40 percent.
```

Thus you can easily go to a requirement and to know if it has Test Cases and which ones. If you upload the file to [TestLink](http://testlink.org/) then you can review the requirements access the execution history, remove the Test Case or go to the Test Cases and edit them all from the requirements.

## Contributing
This is an open project and every contribution is welcome. 
Not all the requirements have enough information, so if you found an area, page, component or function in the Decidim site that has not enough information about it you can add it in its specific chapter or even create a new one following the syntax used in the Decidim's functionalities and features Roadmap 2017-2018 v.1.0 that you may find in the [Documents Folder](#Documents)or the requirements document in html format and xml format in this folder. So your name should look like so:
```
MAIN CHAPTER-VERSION-SUB SECTION UNIQUE IDENTIFIER-SUB SUB SECTION UNIQUE IDENTIFIER, ETC: feature's name.
```
## So far the main chapters are:

- General features 
- Participatory spaces 
- Components 
- Participants 
- Administration Dashboard
- Unknown

So for instance: 
+ “PARTIC-1-REG:Registration, verification and Navigate” **means**: “Participants –version 1-Registration and verification :  Registration, verification and Navigate”

+ “PART-SPACES-INIT-MODE:Technical moderation and validation” **means**: “Participatory Spaces –version 1-Initiatives- technical moderation and validation :  Technical moderation and validation”

+ “ADMIN-1-SET-ART:Area Types” **means**: “Administration–version 1- Settings-Area Types:  Area Types”
