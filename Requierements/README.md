# Requirements
This folder contains documents related with the requirements of the project. 

The requirements file has an index with links to each requirement. Each requirement has a  description, its status, its relations and the Test Cases created for this requirement as well as other information like coverage, links to the test and code created by codegram in github or other relevant information. Thus you can easily go to a requirement and to know if it has Test Cases and which ones. If you upload the file to [TestLink](http://testlink.org/) then you can review the requirements access the execution history, remove the Test Case or go to the Test Cases and edit them all from the requierements.
