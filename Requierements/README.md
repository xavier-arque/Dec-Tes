# Requirements
This folder contains documents related with the requirements of the project. 

The requirements file has an index with links to each requirement. Each requirement has a  description, its status, its relations and the Test Cases created for this requirement as well as other information like coverage, links to the test and code created by codegram in github or other relevant information. 

```Coverage: A value of e.g. "40% (8/20)" means that 20 Test Cases have to be created for this Requirement to test it completely. 8 of those have already been created and linked to this Requirement, which makes a coverage of 40 percent. 

Thus you can easily go to a requirement and to know if it has Test Cases and which ones. If you upload the file to [TestLink](http://testlink.org/) then you can review the requirements access the execution history, remove the Test Case or go to the Test Cases and edit them all from the requierements.
